A force is applied to an unsupported portion of the tile specimen until breakage occurs. The ultimate breaking strength is then recorded in pounds. The ANSI standard requires an average breaking strength of 250 pounds for floor tile.Coefficient of Friction: This is a term used in physics to describe the amount of force required to cause an object to start moving across a surface. Tiles are tested for coefficient of friction in accordance with ASTM C-1028. A quantitative value can be determined to generally express the relative degree of slip resistance. A higher coefficient indicates increased resistance. Although there is no current ANSI requirement, a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.50 (wet and dry) is the recognized industry standard for a slip-resistant flooring surface. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also recommends this same standard for walking surfaces. The ADA recommends a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) for accessible routes and 0.80 for ramps.Scratch Hardness (Mohs Hardness): The relative hardness of glazed tile is an important issue that should be addressed when selecting tile. Scratch resistance of glazes is measured by scratching the surface of the tile with different minerals and assigning a “Mohs Scale Hardness” number to the glaze, the softest mineral used is talc (a rating of 1) and the hardest is a diamond (a rating of 10 if no scratch). Most glazes used on ceramic tile fall in the five to six range, which is also slightly harder than most steels. Case-hardened steel, such as what is used in drill bits, is approximately six and will scratch most glazes. Quartz, No. 7 on the Mohs scale, will scratch most glazes (sand is a common example of natural quartz).Tile is appropriate for all areas that may be subject to high foot traffic, wetness, and require the need for increased durability, for example, dining facilities, kitchens, break rooms, restrooms, entry lobbies, floors, walls, and similar.Technical Criteria: Select tile based on the performance criteria appropriate for the functional use of the space. There are five properties of ceramic tile to consider: coefficient of friction, durability classification or Porcelain Enamel Institute, scratch hardness, breaking strength, and water absorption.Select tiles with the following properties:Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile. Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts.If possible, use a dark tone grout, which coordinates with the floor tile to avoid a stained or soiled appearance.","text_html":"<strong>Breaking Strength: </strong>In order to determine the strength and durability of ceramic tile, a standard test method (ASTM C648) is used to evaluate the tile.

Standards\n            \n              General Performance: Design fume hoods so that, when connected to exhaust system that provides exhaust volume indicated on the drawings under normal laboratory conditions, fume hoods will operate in a safe, consistent, and efficient manner, within acceptable tolerances for face velocities specified. Dead air pockets and reverse air currents will not be permitted along surface of hood interiors. Negative variations of face velocity must not exceed 20% of the average face velocity.\n              Static Pressure Loss: Design fume hoods to minimize static pressure loss. Static pressure loss through the variable air volume (VAV) restricted bypass fume hoods must be no more than 0.20 inch of water gauge when hood operates at the containment standards listed in this specification.\n              Containment per ASHRAE 110: Provide fume hoods that have a face velocity of 100 feet per minute (fpm) (0.51 meter per second) and a release rate of 4.0 liter per minute (Lpm) when tested in accordance with ASHRAE 110:\n                \n                  VAV bypass low-velocity fume hood(s) at a face velocity of 84 fpm with sash at 18 inches open and 55 fpm with sash at 28 inches open\n                  As-Manufactured Rating: AM 0.05 (0.05 ppm]\n                  As-Installed Rating: AI 0.10 (0.10 ppm)\n                \n              \n            \n            Quality Assurance\n            \n              Source Quality Control: Manufacturer is required to demonstrate hood performance prior to shipment to prove compliance with contract requirements.

It will be mowed only twice per year when recommended.Maintained Zone: This zone is located around the immediate perimeter of a building or the center of a main space, such as the town center. Areas in this zone will have turf grass that will be mowed on a regular basis to keep a manicured look. The zone should be drought resistant and also contain native trees for shade and ornamental grasses and native shrubs for color and variety. Ornamental grasses and shrubs should be located in areas close to building entrances. Design should be simple in nature but bold in color. All landscaping should be to maintain.Flightline Zone: The Flight Line Zone is similar to the Maintained Zone except that tree use should be limited and not be planted close to the runway. Trees should be placed further back toward the second row of structures. Trees should be limited to species that do not attract birds. See AFI 91-212, especially Chapter 3 for vegetation requirements to minimize attractiveness to wildlife near the flightline.The Installation will have limited irrigation except in the Maintained Zone, which might receive water through a rainwater harvesting system.

Temporary irrigation may be used to establish plantings once they are first planted but not after one growing season.Plant selection must be as specified herein. Contractor/designer has the ability to modify the planting pallet as long as it is approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service representative on the Installation. It must be native and found in the local environment having shown resiliency to drought and establishment in native soils.Street landscaping must be similar to the zone in which it is planted, most likely in the Transition Zone. Bioswales should use planting recommended by Florida Fish and Wildlife that is capable of living in varied conditions of short-term flooding to drought. Major streets should be lined with native trees to provide shade and direct traffic. Trees must be planted on the land side of sidewalks and not between sidewalks and curbs.Parking lots should have native species of trees, shrubs, and grasses arranged in large groups to form a designed look instead of a native, organic look. For islands with drainage, plants should be able to withstand the same conditions specified for bioswales. Use trees for shade where appropriate. Do not plant trees in small island spaces; plant them in the outside perimeter of the parking lot or in islands that are no less than 10 feet wide.Plantings for screening must be native and evergreen of medium height.Drip irrigation will be used in shrub planting areas adjacent to building entrances where special planting occurs. The water should not be potable and should come from rainwater harvesting.Temporary irrigation will be used by the contractor to establish all plantings for one growing season as part of their contract. After one season, planting must be weaned off water over a 6 month period to allow plants to acclimate to local conditions. ","text_html":"The landscape design must be defined by four zones: Natural Perimeter Zone, Transition Zone, Maintained Zone, and Flight Line Zone."},{"heading":"32 93 00\tPlants","text":"\n            Native and adapted non-invasive plans help to maintain ecosystem service, increase biodiversity, provide wildlife habitat, minimize the use of fertilizer and pesticides, and require minimum maintenance.
