Severely steep sloped roofs of greater than 5:12 pitch should be avoided because they can become &#x201C;sails&#x201D; that catch more wind and are subject to both higher uplift and overturning forces.","topics":{"usage":{"text_units":1,"text_characters":667,"features":4},"relations":[],"language":"en","keywords":[{"text":"low-slope roofs","relevance":0.963159,"count":1},{"text":"roof designs","relevance":0.812311,"count":1},{"text":"preferred slope","relevance":0.790967,"count":1},{"text":"strict adherence","relevance":0.764008,"count":1},{"text":"roofing systems","relevance":0.653769,"count":1},{"text":"hip-style roofs","relevance":0.63772,"count":1},{"text":"slope","relevance":0.564777,"count":1},{"text":"manufactures requirements","relevance":0.536497,"count":1},{"text":"roofs","relevance":0.533672,"count":2},{"text":"pitch","relevance":0.529055,"count":1},{"text":"sails","relevance":0.52255,"count":1},{"text":"wind","relevance":0.520044,"count":1},{"text":"resistance","relevance":0.513684,"count":1},{"text":"forces","relevance":0.504586,"count":1},{"text":"hip-style roof design","relevance":0.504519,"count":1},{"text":"architectural design intent","relevance":0.455808,"count":1},{"text":"area’s high rainfall","relevance":0.405783,"count":1},{"text":"uplift forces","relevance":0.376906,"count":1},{"text":"Gable","relevance":0.369826,"count":1},{"text":"various geometries","relevance":0.368854,"count":1},{"text":"higher uplift","relevance":0.349755,"count":1}],"entities":[{"type":"Quantity","text":"12 pitch","relevance":0.978348,"mentions":[{"text":"12 pitch","location":[526,534],"confidence":0.8}],"count":1,"confidence":0.8}],"concepts":[{"text":"Roof","relevance":0.987356,"dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roof"},{"text":"Roofs","relevance":0.883905,"dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roofs"},{"text":"Gable","relevance":0.643281,"dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gable"},{"text":"Imbrex and tegula","relevance":0.619873,"dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imbrex_and_tegula"},{"text":"Hip roof","relevance":0.603026,"dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hip_roof"},{"text":"Architectural design","relevance":0.563044,"dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Architectural_design"}]}}],"div-07-40-00":[{"heading":"div-07-40-00","text":"Material must be aluminum.

Where a conflict exists within this standard and other applicable codes or standards, the more stringent must apply.

Such items as vinyl composition tile (VCT), ceramic and other surface tile, plastic laminates, toilet partitions, lockers, window blinds, all modular or systems furniture panels, work surfaces, flipper doors, and similar are considered permanent finishes. Generally permanent finishes need to be a color that will not become dated in a few years.","text_html":"Durability, maintenance, and cost-efficiency are primary considerations in choosing interior finishes. Neutral base colors with contrasting accented accessories should be applied when appropriate. Specialty areas may have specific requirements that need to be determined on an individual basis. The designer must consider the applicable UFC, building codes, fire ratings, acoustical performance, structural needs, and thermal and moisture transmission characteristics when designing project-specific interior assemblies.

A force is applied to an unsupported portion of the tile specimen until breakage occurs. The ultimate breaking strength is then recorded in pounds. The ANSI standard requires an average breaking strength of 250 pounds for floor tile.Coefficient of Friction: This is a term used in physics to describe the amount of force required to cause an object to start moving across a surface. Tiles are tested for coefficient of friction in accordance with ASTM C-1028. A quantitative value can be determined to generally express the relative degree of slip resistance. A higher coefficient indicates increased resistance. Although there is no current ANSI requirement, a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.50 (wet and dry) is the recognized industry standard for a slip-resistant flooring surface. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also recommends this same standard for walking surfaces. The ADA recommends a minimum coefficient of friction of 0.60 (wet and dry) for accessible routes and 0.80 for ramps.Scratch Hardness (Mohs Hardness): The relative hardness of glazed tile is an important issue that should be addressed when selecting tile. Scratch resistance of glazes is measured by scratching the surface of the tile with different minerals and assigning a “Mohs Scale Hardness” number to the glaze, the softest mineral used is talc (a rating of 1) and the hardest is a diamond (a rating of 10 if no scratch). Most glazes used on ceramic tile fall in the five to six range, which is also slightly harder than most steels. Case-hardened steel, such as what is used in drill bits, is approximately six and will scratch most glazes. Quartz, No. 7 on the Mohs scale, will scratch most glazes (sand is a common example of natural quartz).Tile is appropriate for all areas that may be subject to high foot traffic, wetness, and require the need for increased durability, for example, dining facilities, kitchens, break rooms, restrooms, entry lobbies, floors, walls, and similar.Technical Criteria: Select tile based on the performance criteria appropriate for the functional use of the space. There are five properties of ceramic tile to consider: coefficient of friction, durability classification or Porcelain Enamel Institute, scratch hardness, breaking strength, and water absorption.Select tiles with the following properties:Functional/Aesthetic Criteria: Some products work better in certain functional areas than others. The pattern, texture, and color or combination of colors will greatly influence the overall appearance of tile. Consider the amount of cleaning and maintenance required when selecting particular tiles and grouts.If possible, use a dark tone grout, which coordinates with the floor tile to avoid a stained or soiled appearance.","text_html":"<strong>Breaking Strength: </strong>In order to determine the strength and durability of ceramic tile, a standard test method (ASTM C648) is used to evaluate the tile.

Use roll-form aluminum roof panels. The profile must be a minimum 2-1/2-inch-high standing seam with a 18 inch coverage. Panels must be formed with vertical ribs at the panel edges and intermediate stiffening ribs that are symmetrically spaced between the ribs. The panels must be designed for sequential installation by mechanically attaching panels to supports using concealed clips that are located under one side of panels, engaging opposite edge of adjacent panels, and mechanically seaming the panels together.Continuous roof panels are required unless the length of the roof dictates the use of a splice and this is acceptable to the Government. If required, locate the roofing splices over, but not attached to, structural supports. Stagger roof splices and end laps to avoid a four-panel lap splice condition. Install backing plates at roofing splices.\n              Provide a self-adhering, high-temperature sheet underlayment over entire roof field. Underlayment must be a minimum 60 mils thick, consisting of a slip-resistant rubber, with release-paper backing; specifically designed to withstand high metal temperatures beneath metal roofing. Provide primer according to written recommendations of underlayment manufacturer.Operable dry floodproofing gates can be used to prevent flood waters such as storm surge from entering a building during severe weather events.Temporary or permanent flood barriers may be installed to protect buildings located within the floodplain or that have finished floor elevations located below the established DFE. Flood barriers are best suited for protection of existing buildings and sensitive or critical infrastructure located within flood zones or areas at risk of flooding. Flood barriers are not intended to replace appropriate building and infrastructure minimum design criteria for new construction and major renovation projects. All new capital projects must follow the minimum design criteria as provided in Division 01.Operable flood-proofing barriers may include the following, or similar, as approved by the USAF:All building flood barriers must for provide for rapid deployment in advance of a flood event. Building flood barriers must be constructed of non-corrosive materials with stainless steel fasteners. Flexible and ridged blood barriers are permitted. Flood log-style or similar barriers that are not permanently attached to a building but are located adjacent to the building opening and/or stored in another location away from building openings are not allowed for building opening protection.Dry floodproofing measures are not permitted for use on buildings below the base flood elevation in Coastal High Hazard Areas, Coastal A Zones, as defined by the current FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map panel.If a building is designed for occupation during flood conditions, at least one exit door or emergency escape/rescue opening must be provided above the elevation specified for dry floodproofing.Two methods are specified to meet the standards for flood openings in walls of enclosures below elevated buildings to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater:The performance of engineered openings must account for the presence of louvers, blades, screens, grilles, faceplates, or other covers and devices and must ensure that the difference between the exterior and interior floodwater levels cannot exceed 1 foot. Installation of all flood openings must be in at least two walls and must be no more than 1 foot above the higher of the interior grade or floor and the finished exterior grade immediately under each opening.All breakaway walls in all flood hazard areas must have flood openings. Walls designed to break away must not produce debris that is capable of damaging structures.Temporary flood barriers can also be used to protect equipment such as electrical and communications that are sensitive to flood exposure. These flood barriers may be flexible or rigid, and may be stored away from the equipment they are designed to protect; however, they must be rapidly deployable and stored near the site of their intended use. Barrier types must be manufactured of non-corrosive materials with stainless-steel fasteners.Removable flood barriers may include the following, or similar, as approved by the USAF:Hurricane shutters must carry Miami-Dade NOA approvals. Removable shutters are not allowed, as components requiring storage, are often misplaced, or lost, and require more installation time.Assembly should be recessed into the wall opening flush with wall plane. If roll-up housing protrudes past the wall plane, the top must be sloped to discourage bird nesting and to prevent corrosion from standing rain water. All coiling shutters must have interior manual operations or electronic operation with manual back-up operation.Side-hinged colonial casement-type shutters must be hardened with a 1/4-inch (7 mm)-thick minimum solid polycarbonate panel on the interior side attached with Type 316 stainless-steel hardware and fasteners. Type 316 stainless-steel securing brackets must be an integral part of the shutters (nonremovable) and mechanically locked to secure shutters in closed position.Sun-Control DevicesSun-control devices must be integrated on the building exteriors to shield direct sunlight on glazing and to reduce cooling load and glare while maximizing daylight to interior spaces. These devices must be integrated into the building construction, so they do not appear as an afterthought addition, do not collect dirt, and allow for easy window cleaning. Sun-control devices may include overhangs, canopies, louvers, solar screens, and trellises. Light shelves installed on the exterior (and or interior) of windows are another type of shading device that increase light penetration into the building interior. Elements typically include horizontal, vertical, cantilevered, and suspended, supports and surfaces. The material for exterior sun control devices may be of concrete or aluminum.If window blinds are used, they must not be of reflective metal.Manufacturer must provide compete design, including anchorages and supports that withstand the High-Velocity Hurricane Wind loads designated for the area.Flagpoles must be cone or entasis-tapered (match existing on the Installation) fabricated from seamless extruded tubing.

If roll-up housing protrudes past the wall plane, the top must be sloped to discourage bird nesting and to prevent corrosion from standing rain water. All coiling shutters must have interior manual operations or electronic operation with manual back-up operation.</p>\n            <h4>Casement (Side-Hinged) Hurricane Shutters</h4>\n            <p>Side-hinged colonial casement-type shutters must be hardened with a 1/4-inch (7 mm)-thick minimum solid polycarbonate panel on the interior side attached with Type 316 stainless-steel hardware and fasteners. Type 316 stainless-steel securing brackets must be an integral part of the shutters (nonremovable) and mechanically locked to secure shutters in closed position.</p>\n            <p><strong>Sun-Control Devices</strong></p>\n            <p>Sun-control devices must be integrated on the building exteriors to shield direct sunlight on glazing and to reduce cooling load and glare while maximizing daylight to interior spaces. These devices must be integrated into the building construction, so they do not appear as an afterthought addition, do not collect dirt, and allow for easy window cleaning. Sun-control devices may include overhangs, canopies, louvers, solar screens, and trellises. Light shelves installed on the exterior (and or interior) of windows are another type of shading device that increase light penetration into the building interior. Elements typically include horizontal, vertical, cantilevered, and suspended, supports and surfaces. The material for exterior sun control devices may be of concrete or aluminum.</p>\n            <p>If window blinds are used, they must not be of reflective metal.</p>\n

Consider what treatment would be required to achieve potable water standards from harvested rainwater. The rainwater may be used for landscape irrigation or other nonpotable uses (such as toilet flushing or fire water tank storage) during normal operation. Design should assume that the rainwater harvesting system must operate by gravity or by connection to onsite backup electrical generation during a service interruption from the public water supply.The Environmental Resource Permit Applicant’s Handbook Volume II design manual published by FDEP and Northwest Florida Water Management District contains local design criteria for rainwater harvesting.

The genset supplier must submit fuel consumption data for 50%, 75%, and 100% of rated output capacity. The genset design should include a day tank sized for a minimum of 4 hours of operation at full load without refilling. The unit should also have a main storage tank sized for 7 days of operation at full load without refilling. An auxiliary pump must be included to transfer fuel from the main storage tank to the day tank. Provide a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan.Lightning protection for this equipment must adhere to the recommendations and requirements of the following standards:In general, the duel-fuel genset should adhere to the requirements of UFC 3-540-01, Engine-driven Generator Systems for Prime and Standby Power Applications, and UFGS 26 32 15.00 10, Diesel-Generator Set Stationary 100-2500 kW, with Auxiliaries, including the guidelines for UFGS 26 32 15.00 10. This genset is intended to be connected to the Tyndall AFB distribution grid and operate in island mode or isolated in parallel with other generators on the Tyndall AFB distribution grid.The unit will be expected to operate on Jet A, instead of diesel fuel, of the same specifications as delivered to Tyndall AFB for aviation use but with provision for adding any chemicals necessary to meet the engine manufacturer’s minimum fuel specifications regarding lubricity for equipment wear, especially the engine fuel pump. The chemical addition unit should be designed to add the chemicals as fuel is transferred from the genset’s main fuel storage tank to the day tank. In addition, the genset must be able to operate on a mixture of natural gas and Jet A, with a minimum of 30% natural gas in the mixture. The genset must be able to shift from 100% liquid fuel to the natural gas/liquid mixture and back without losing power.Operational classification of the genset will generally be in accordance with NFPA 110 as Level 2, Class 4, Type 120. Gensets that will be used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be rated as prime power. The genset application designation for units used to power the Tyndall AFB distribution system must be considered to be “parallel with other generators on an isolated bus.”Fuel consumption limitations and testing as described in UFGS 26 32 15.00 10 paragraphs 2.1.10, 2.1.11, and 3.6.11 are not applicable.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Balancing Airport Stormwater and Bird Hazard Management (2015) contains additional design suggestions for reducing the attractiveness of stormwater management facilities to wildlife.Stormwater QualityProject teams are encouraged to exceed UFC 3-210-10, Low-Impact Development, for minimum requirements for improved environmental performance.Stormwater QuantityImpacts on runoff rates and volumes must be considered as a key component of site design. Project teams must evaluate and use as appropriate stormwater management design strategies including:Documentation Project teams must provide the S+R Coordinator with the following onsite stormwater management documentation:The hot mix asphalt used for shared-use paths must be composed of 100% RAP. Asphalt mixes for roads and parking lots should use RAP to the maximum extent allowed by UFGS Division 32 specifications.Porous asphalt paving must not be used within roadways or UFC-required parking areas on the Installation. Parking lots provided beyond the minimum parking requirements per the UFC (that is, overflow parking) must use a form of permeable paving systems.In addition to UFC standards, roadway, shared-use path, sidewalk, driveway, and parking lot pavement must be designed in accordance with Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Design Manuals, FDOT Pavement Type Selection Manual, and FDOT Flexible Pavement Design Manual. Use FDOT District 6 criteria for pavement design in adverse conditions including saturated soils.All vehicular roadway surfaces must use Long Life Pavement Design in accordance with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Guide for the Design of Pavement Structures to protect the facility from storm damage and ensure longer pavement life-cycle.Pervious concrete paving must not be used within roadways or UFC-required parking areas on the Installation. Pervious pavement is allowed to be used for overflow or surge parking areas.In addition to UFC standards, roadways, shared-use paths, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lot pavement must be designed in accordance with FDOT Design Manuals, FDOT Pavement Type Selection Manual, FDOT Rigid Pavement Design Manual, and FDOT Flexible Pavement Design Manual.All vehicular roadway surfaces must use Long Life Pavement Design in accordance with the AASHTO Guide for the Design of Pavement Structures to protect the facility from storm damage and ensure longer pavement life-cycle.See Division 34, Transportation, for standard road sections.Pavers must be used at entries or plaza areas in front of Group 1 structures, public gathering areas such as memorials, or in the Installation center. Paved plazas must have restrained edges that use adjacent existing pavement, flush concrete curb, or metal edge restraint. The paving design pattern should include a paver band, such as a solider or a sailor course. Pavers must have clean, tight cuts to fit against elements within the paved plaza.Pavers must be concrete pavers of the approved color, size, and finish. The color range must complement architecture materials.Use permeable paving to reduce stormwater runoff in areas of parking that are overflow or areas that are not often used but needed for certain events. Permeable surfaces include permeable concrete pavers, PVC cells filled with stabilized crushed stone, or even crushed shell.Synthetic grass must be Luxury 1st Cut synthetic turf from XGrass, 205 Boring Drive, Dalton, GA 30721: Phone (877) 881-8477 or approved equal.

The zone must have native grasses, shrubs, and trees in accordance with the native planting list developed by the 325 CES Community Planner and Environmental Office.Transition Zone: The Transition Zone must contain mostly native wire and Indian grasses. It will be mowed only twice per year when recommended.Maintained Zone: This zone is located around the immediate perimeter of a building or the center of a main space, such as the town center. Areas in this zone will have turf grass that will be mowed on a regular basis to keep a manicured look. The zone should be drought resistant and also contain native trees for shade and ornamental grasses and native shrubs for color and variety. Ornamental grasses and shrubs should be located in areas close to building entrances. Design should be simple in nature but bold in color. All landscaping should be to maintain.Flightline Zone: The Flight Line Zone is similar to the Maintained Zone except that tree use should be limited and not be planted close to the runway. Trees should be placed further back toward the second row of structures. Trees should be limited to species that do not attract birds. See AFI 91-212, especially Chapter 3 for vegetation requirements to minimize attractiveness to wildlife near the flightline.The Installation will have limited irrigation except in the Maintained Zone, which might receive water through a rainwater harvesting system. Use plant species that are native and drought-tolerant. Temporary irrigation may be used to establish plantings once they are first planted but not after one growing season.Plant selection must be as specified herein. Contractor/designer has the ability to modify the planting pallet as long as it is approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service representative on the Installation. It must be native and found in the local environment having shown resiliency to drought and establishment in native soils.Street landscaping must be similar to the zone in which it is planted, most likely in the Transition Zone. Bioswales should use planting recommended by Florida Fish and Wildlife that is capable of living in varied conditions of short-term flooding to drought. Major streets should be lined with native trees to provide shade and direct traffic. Trees must be planted on the land side of sidewalks and not between sidewalks and curbs.Parking lots should have native species of trees, shrubs, and grasses arranged in large groups to form a designed look instead of a native, organic look. For islands with drainage, plants should be able to withstand the same conditions specified for bioswales. Use trees for shade where appropriate. Do not plant trees in small island spaces; plant them in the outside perimeter of the parking lot or in islands that are no less than 10 feet wide.Plantings for screening must be native and evergreen of medium height.Drip irrigation will be used in shrub planting areas adjacent to building entrances where special planting occurs. The water should not be potable and should come from rainwater harvesting.Temporary irrigation will be used by the contractor to establish all plantings for one growing season as part of their contract. After one season, planting must be weaned off water over a 6 month period to allow plants to acclimate to local conditions. ","text_html":"The landscape design must be defined by four zones: Natural
